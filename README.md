# Unhandled Errors in Node.js HTTP Server

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js applications: the lack of proper error handling in HTTP servers. The initial `bug.js` file showcases a server without error handling, which can lead to unexpected crashes and a poor user experience.  The improved `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the correct way to handle potential errors, providing more robust and resilient server behavior.

## Bug Description

The `bug.js` server lacks error handling.  If any error occurs during request processing (e.g., database connection failure, file system error), the server will crash without providing any useful information about the error. This makes debugging and maintenance extremely difficult.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file addresses this issue by implementing comprehensive error handling using `try...catch` blocks.  This ensures that errors are caught, logged (for debugging purposes), and handled gracefully, preventing unexpected server crashes and providing users with informative error messages.
